Had an MRI scan last wednessday.
Waiting for result now. Somehow I don't feel like I care all that much.
If I have some really bad tumor, maybe I'll just head to the Arctic and never come back.
I would like to die alone in the Arctic. 
I've only ever really felt a sense of belonging in th e Arctic.

Yesterday and today I want cycling. My stamina isn't as great as it was last summer.
I guess depression does that.

Just feeling really unhappy. 
I don't like Vancouver all that much.

You know, for all these people that struggled with isoaltion during Covid, things will return to normal for them.
For me.. things will just stay the same.. just like it was years before Covid happened.

Nothing ever really changed for me.

I don't think things will ever change.

I wish I could atleast find one really cool bug, feel like I did something in my lifetime.

I'm tired. I just want it to end.
