Will have to stop therapy next weekend.
Hit the limits on my insurance and unable to cover it out of pocket.

It's fine, because therapy can't help me. Maybe it helps some people.
But I just really hate this world.

The only thing I've came to realize is that nothing is ever going to change. 
This world is just a sick joke.
