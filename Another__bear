Another weekend of sitting alone in my apartment.

Thinking about the future.

It's really hard to imagine a life worth living.
When I see other people in my age group, they life generally seems to revolve around finding a partner, if they don't already have one.

Even without my insecurities, I don't think that will ever be for me.
A while ago I tried this dating app, Grindr, but I don't know.. I just can't stand intimacy.
Maybe it's my distrust of people. Maybe I just don't like people because I'm a polar bear. 
I just don't see a future that isn't really lonely. 

These last few days I've been thinking a lot about just ending it. 
I used to get panic attacks and do lots of self-harm everytime I started seriously considering suicide.
Now.. I don't get a reaction at all anymore. It's like I've accepted it as something inevitable. 

I really try to rationalize things somehow, I think writing down my thoughts is part of trying to rationalize things.
Is a life of unhappiness and pain even one worth living out? 

I wish things professionally were going better, but I really struggle, I think it's mainly because of being depressed. I just can't get anything done.
On average I spent 12+ hours in bed most days.

I wish I could tell myself depression is just a chemical inbalance, but I just really don't like this world. I feel like a polar bear amongst people.

It's not a big stretch to think that maybe I'm just not compatible with this world.

Not being alive, and not feeling anything, isn't that better then feeling pain every day?

I feel stuck in quicksand, and it's too late to escape it anymore.
