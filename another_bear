4 more months until bottom surgery.

I think a lot about the future. I don't see a future.
I just want to get that surgery, because I hate all the pushback from society I've had to endure, just to be happy with my own body.
I don't want to die with that thing between my legs.

I don't see a future.
Honestly, this world is a sick nightmare.
It's like people banning my from social media and banning my blog, it's not my loss when I die.
A lot of people are really transphobic. There is even hate preachers right where I live, calling being transgender a sin.
I don't understand why people tolerate such things. 
Sometimes I feel a lot of anger.
But let them be the ones that lived a life of harassing others.. I wonder how they will look back on life on their death-bed.
I ask my therapist why people harass others. Apparently harassing others makes them feel better about their own shitty life, or something.
Humans are so ugly. I'm no saint either. I sometimes fantasize about visiting the stalkers that sent me hateful emails and beating the shit of them with a metal baseball bat..
It's funny.. because it doesn't even scare me that I hate these people so much, that I would probably be even capable of such violence.
But the thing is, when you're a minority, you can't ever react with violence.. because then you become the monster that people say you are.

People think being transgender is a choice. It's not. If it was a choice, no sane person would open themselves up to a lifetime of harassment.

I think a lot about the end. It's a paradox, dead feeling like such a relief in my head, even though you cannot feel anything when you're dead, not even relief.
I wish I could attribute how I feel to isolation, but to be honest, this shitty world, the way people are, it's like being in a nightmare. I just want to wake up from the nightmare.

I think a lot about when I was in the Arctic. It's funny how a cold desolate place is the only place in this world where I got to experience beauty.

I know that some people will be happy if I'm dead, like those retards emailing me to kill myself.. but it's really not my loss. I lose nothing by not being in a nightmare anymore.
